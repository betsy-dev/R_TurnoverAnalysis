# R_TurnoverAnalysis
Files associated with the Turnover analysis project using R

This project involves performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a turnover dataset using R. Key steps include:

• Imported and inspected the dataset to understand its structure, including rows, columns,
and variable types.

• Visualized employee work experience distribution.

• Analyzed transport mode distribution and compared personality traits (extraversion and
self-control) by gender through descriptive statistics and bar plots.

• Identified the profession with the highest average work experience and analyzed coaching
proportions by gender using cross-tabulation.

• Documented the analysis in R markdown and produced a final Word file with results and
interpretations.

Deliverables:
R scripts for analysis
Descriptive statistics, histograms, bar charts, and cross-tabulations
R markdown script and Word file with results and interpretations.
