# R_TurnoverAnalysis
Files associated with the Turnover analysis project using R

This project involves performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a turnover dataset using R. Key steps include:

Dataset Inspection: Import the turnover Excel file and inspect the structure (rows, columns, variable types).
Work Experience Distribution: Visualize the distribution of employee work experience using a red-colored histogram.
Personality Traits: Analyze the average levels of extraversion and anxiety using descriptive statistics (mean, median).
Gender Distribution: Create a bar chart to show gender distribution across different professions, with a green color scheme.
Industry vs Experience: Investigate the relationship between industry and experience using cross-tabulation.
Transport Mode: Analyze the distribution of employees' transport modes using a bar chart.
Personality by Gender: Compare personality traits (extraversion and self-control) between genders using descriptive statistics and bar plots.
Profession with Highest Work Experience: Identify the profession with the highest average work experience using a summary table or bar chart.
Coaching Proportions: Analyze the proportion of employees receiving coaching based on gender using cross-tabulation.
Documentation: Copy the R script code into R markdown, run the analysis, and output results in a Word document with interpretations.
Deliverables:

R scripts for analysis
Descriptive statistics, histograms, bar charts, and cross-tabulations
R markdown script and Word file with results and interpretations.
